# the objective of this file is to predict the energy consumption of the next 24 hours 
# to do this, we want to find "the shape" of the consumption curve 
# we notice that this shape per hour is quite similar over time
# of hours but with a different amplitude

# the shape is dependent on the season
# we will use the consumption data of the year 2022 and 2023:
# the file used will be: eCO2mix_RTE_tempo_2022-2023.csv
# this file contains hour by hour consumption data for the whole of France.
# in our case it would have been better to find the form of the consumption for a house.
# 
# from this file, we created a csv file that contains the average consumption of France per hour of the year 2022 and 2023
# we will normalize the consumption according to the expected consumption of the total house in a day
# this expected consumption per day of the dwelling is very dependent on the types of dwellings, of these methods of heatings, of insulation and of the size of the dwelling.
